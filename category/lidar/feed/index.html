<p>Single-photon lidar is an emerging ranging technique that can obtain 3D information at kilometre distance with centimetre precision, and has important applications in <strong><a href="https://tachella.github.io//2020/08/01/advances-in-single-photon-lidar-for-autonomous-vehicles/" data-type="post" data-id="337">self-driving cars</a>, forest canopy monitoring, <a href="https://tachella.github.io//2020/09/01/seeing-around-corners-with-edge-resolved-transient-imaging/" data-type="post" data-id="429">non-line-of-sight imaging</a> </strong>and more. This modality consists of contracting a histogram of time-of-arrival of individual photons per pixel. For each object in the line-of-sight of the device there is a peak in the histogram. These peaks are found by a 3D reconstruction algorithm that takes into account the Poisson statistics of the photon-count data, while promoting spatial smoothness in the reconstructed point clouds. In a previous post, I presented <a href="https://tachella.github.io//2019/10/29/real-time-3d-reconstruction-from-single-photon-lidar-data-using-plug-and-play-point-cloud-denoisers/" data-type="post" data-id="210">an algorithm</a> that can find multiple peaks per pixel in a matter of milliseconds even in challenging very long range scenarios with high background noise. As the algorithm needs to process the histogram data, the <strong>reconstruction time</strong> depends (linearly) on the total number of non-zero bins in the histogram:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://tachella.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/02/timing_bins-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-477" width="509" height="241"/><figcaption>Fig. 1: Execution time of a 3D reconstruction algorithm as a function the number of non-zero bins in the collected time-of-arrival histograms (from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12943-7">this paper</a>).</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As single-photon lidar arrays get bigger and faster, the number of photons collected per histogram gets bigger, while there is an increased need for faster real-time frame rates. The volume of photon data that needs to be transmitted is ever-increasingly large, generating a <strong>data transfer bottleneck</strong>. Moreover, reconstruction algorithms are required to deal with ever-increasingly large and dense histograms, generating a <strong>computational bottleneck</strong>. So far, most attempts to alleviate these bottlenecks consisted in building coarser histograms. Despite reducing the amount of information to be transferred and processed, this approach sacrifices important depth resolution.</p>



<p>Here, we propose a sketching method to massively <strong>compress the histograms without any significant loss of information</strong>, removing the data and computational bottlenecks. The technique builds on recent advances in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07180">compressive learning</a>, a theory for compressing distributions. The compressed data consists of a series of $K$ statistics </p>



<p>$$\Phi_k(t) = [\cos(w_k t),  \sin(w_kt)]^{T} \quad \text{for} \quad k=1, \dots, K$$</p>



<p>where $t$ denotes the time of arrival. The statistics can be <strong>computed on-the-fly</strong>, i.e. updated with each photon arrival, hence completely by-passing the need to construct a histogram. Below you can see the large difference between reducing the data by coarse binning the histogram and our proposed method:</p>

<p>Seeing around the corners is a task that may sound&nbsp;<strong>impossible at first glance</strong>. This task has many important applications, such as&nbsp;<strong>anticipatory imaging in self-driving cars, planetary exploration or search and rescue operations</strong>. In this paper, we present a novel imaging technique which allows to obtain 2.5 dimensional information about hidden (non-line-of-sight) scenes. Our method obtains angular information using corners and depth information using a time-resolved camera (a single-photon lidar). Recovering the hidden room configuration constitutes&nbsp;<strong>non-linear inverse problem</strong>, which we solve by proposing a careful modelling of the measurement operator (the light transport equation) and a reconstruction algorithm which exploits our prior knowledge about plausible configurations.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The safety and success of autonomous vehicles (AVs) depend on their ability to accurately map and respond to their surroundings in real time. One of the most promising recent technologies for depth mapping is single-photon lidar (SPL), which measures the time of flight of individual photons. The long-range capabilities (kilometers), excellent depth resolution (centimeters), and use of low-power (eye-safe) laser sources renders this modality a strong candidate for use in AVs. While presenting unique opportunities, the remarkable sensitivity of single-photon detectors introduces several signal processing challenges. The discrete nature of photon counting and the particular design of the detection devices means the acquired signals cannot be treated as arising in a linear system with additive Gaussian noise. Moreover, the number of useful photon detections may be small despite a large data volume, thus requiring careful modeling and algorithmic design for real-time performance. This article discusses the main working principles of SPL and summarizes recent advances in signal processing techniques for this modality, highlighting promising applications in AVs as well as a number of challenges for vehicular lidar that cannot be solved by better hardware alone.</p>

<h5>Abstract:</h5>
<p>Single-photon lidar devices can acquire 3D data at very long range with high precision. Moreover, recent advances in lidar<br />
arrays have enabled acquisitions at very high frame rates. However, these devices place a severe bottleneck on the reconstruction algorithms, which have to handle very large volumes of noisy data. Recently, real-time 3D reconstruction of distributed surfaces has been demonstrated obtaining information at one wavelength. Here, we propose a new algorithm that achieves color 3D reconstruction without increasing the execution time nor the acquisition process of the real-time single-wavelength reconstruction system. The algorithm uses a coded aperture that compresses the data by considering a subset of the wavelengths per pixel. The reconstruction algorithm is based on a plug-and-play denoising framework, which benefits from off-the-shelf point cloud and image denoisers. Experiments using real lidar data show the competitivity of the proposed method.</p>

<h5>Abstract:</h5>
<p>Single-photon lidar has emerged as a prime candidate technology for depth imaging through challenging environments. Until now, a major limitation has been the significant amount of time required for the analysis of the recorded data. Here we show a new computational framework for real-time three-dimensional (3D) scene reconstruction from single-photon data. By combining statistical models with highly scalable computational tools from the computer graphics community, we demonstrate 3D reconstruction of complex outdoor scenes with processing times of the order of 20 ms, where the lidar data was acquired in broad daylight from distances up to 320 metres. The proposed method can handle an unknown number of surfaces in each pixel, allowing for target detection and imaging through cluttered scenes. This enables robust, real-time target reconstruction of complex moving scenes, paving the way for single-photon lidar at video rates for practical 3D imaging applications.</p>

<h5>Abstract:</h5>
<p>Light detection and ranging (lidar) single-photon devices capture range and intensity information from a 3D scene. This modality enables long range 3D reconstruction with high range precision and low laser power. A multispectral single-photon lidar system provides additional spectral diversity, allowing the discrimination of different materials. However, the main drawback of such systems can be the long acquisition time needed to collect enough photons in each spectral band. In this work, we tackle this problem in two ways: first, we propose a Bayesian 3D reconstruction algorithm that is able to find multiple surfaces per pixel, using few photons, i.e., shorter acquisitions. In contrast to previous algorithms, the novel method processes the jointly all the spectral bands, obtaining better reconstructions using less photon detections. The proposed model promotes spatial correlation between neighbouring points within a given surface using spatial point processes. Secondly, we account for different spatial and spectral subsampling schemes, which reduce the total number of measurements, without significant degradation of the reconstruction performance. In this way, the total acquisition time, memory requirements and computational time can be significantly reduced. The experiments performed using both synthetic and real single-photon lidar data demonstrate the advantages of tailored sampling schemes over random alternatives. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm yields better estimates than other existing methods for multi-surface reconstruction using multispectral Lidar data.</p>

<h5>Abstract:</h5>
<p>Single-photon light detection and ranging (lidar) devices can be used to obtain range and reflectivity information from 3D scenes. However, reconstructing the 3D surfaces from the raw waveforms can be very challenging, in particular when the number of spurious background detections is large compared to the number of signal detections. In this paper, we introduce a new and fast detection algorithm, which can be used to assess the presence of objects/surfaces in each waveform, allowing only the histograms where the imaged surfaces are present to be further processed. The method is compared to state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods using synthetic and real single-photon data and the results illustrate its benefits for fast and robust target detection using single-photon data.</p>

<h5>Abstract:</h5>
<p>Single-photon light detection and ranging (lidar) data can be used to capture depth and intensity profiles of a 3D scene. In a general setting, the scenes can have an unknown number of surfaces per pixel (semi-transparent surfaces or outdoor measurements), high background noise (strong ambient illumination), can be acquired by systems with a broad instrumental response (non-parallel laser beam with respect to the target surface) and with possibly high attenuating media (underwater conditions). The existing methods generally tackle only a subset of these problems and can fail in a more general scenario. In this paper, we propose a new 3D reconstruction algorithm that can handle all the aforementioned difficulties. The novel algorithm estimates the broadening of the impulse response, considers the attenuation induced by scattering media, while allowing for multiple surfaces per pixel. A series of experiments performed in real long-range and underwater lidar datasets demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</p>

<h5>Abstract:</h5>
<p>Light detection and ranging (Lidar) data can be used to capture the depth and intensity profile of a 3D scene. This modality relies on constructing, for each pixel, a histogram of time delays between emitted light pulses and detected photon arrivals. In a general setting, more than one surface can be observed in a single pixel. The problem of estimating the number of surfaces, their reflectivity and position becomes very challenging in the low-photon regime (which equates to short acquisition times) or relatively high background levels (i.e., strong ambient illumination). This paper presents a new approach to 3D reconstruction using single-photon, single-wavelength Lidar data, which is capable of identifying multiple surfaces in each pixel. Adopting a Bayesian approach, the 3D structure to be recovered is modelled as a marked point process and reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJ-MCMC) moves are proposed to sample the posterior distribution of interest. In order to promote spatial correlation between points belonging to the same surface, we propose a prior that combines an area interaction process and a Strauss process. New RJ-MCMC dilation and erosion updates are presented to achieve an efficient exploration of the configuration space. To further reduce the computational load, we adopt a multiresolution approach, processing the data from a coarse to the finest scale. The experiments performed with synthetic and real data show that the algorithm obtains better reconstructions than other recently published optimization algorithms for lower execution times.</p>
